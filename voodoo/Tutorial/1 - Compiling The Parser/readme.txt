The parser used by voodoo-mock is the LLVM C++ complier, CLang. The
parser is accessed using the Python API to libclang.so.

Compiled versions:
------------------
Ubuntu - the libclang.so in the main directory is compiled with the
         default tools of the latest ubuntu at this time - 13.04

Procceed to subfolders if you still must compile the parser. It should take
up to 30 minutes.
